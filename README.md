# Data Structures in C#

This repository contains implementations of key data structures in C#. Each structure is implemented efficiently for educational and practical use.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Array
Arrays are collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. They allow for fast access to elements via indices.

### Linked List
Linked lists are collections of elements called nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. They allow for efficient insertion and removal of elements.

### Stack
Stacks are collections of elements that follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed. They are used for memory management, undo/redo operations, and more.

### Queue
Queues are collections of elements that follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed. They are used in process management, waiting systems, and more.
